	  <p>Welcome to our survey application, Survey Snake. The idea came into fruition because we had no choice. It was tasked to us by our taskmasters, Kevin and Alyssa. And sometimes Zach, although he is generally less threatening. As far as team dynamic goes, there are a lot of strong personalities. Expecially Alex's snake. Ask Amara.</p>
